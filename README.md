## Project Overview

### Puzzle Master: A Multi-Level Puzzle Learning Game

Puzzle Master is an educational puzzle game that challenges players with a variety of puzzles across different domains: Mathematics, Word Games, and Logic Puzzles. The game is designed to demonstrate the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and software design best practices.

## Game Concept

Players progress through levels by solving puzzles of increasing complexity:
- **Puzzle Types**:
  1. Mathematical Challenges
  2. Word Puzzles
  3. Logical Reasoning Problems

- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Multiple difficulty levels
  - Scoring system
  - Progressive level advancement
  - Dynamic puzzle generation

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

This project strictly adheres to the TDD workflow:

### TDD Cycle Stages
- **Red**: Write a failing test
- **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
- **Refactor**: Improve code design without changing behavior
